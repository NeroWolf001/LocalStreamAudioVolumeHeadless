# LocalStreamAudioVolumeHeadless
This neos headless mod 
[NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos](https://neos.com/) headless that sets the default volume of user audio streams to 0 and equips them with local audio.

This mod is intended for headless use. However, it will work on worlds that you host locally and only worlds hosted by you. NML config options allow you to toggle this on and off.

# Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [LocalVideoPlayerVolumeHeadless.dll](https://github.com/NeroWolf001/LocalStreamAudioVolumeHeadless/releases/latest/download/LocalAudioStreamVolumeHeadless.dll) into your nml_mods folder. This folder should be at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
